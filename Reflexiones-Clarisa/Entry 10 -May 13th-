                                -Math in Software Engineering-

Well, let me say this first. I don't hate math, it just makes me really anxious and for some reason 
i can't stand to take math test's, i get really nervous and my hands start shaking, and i swear i forget
everything. It's officially 3 years since i started this career, and till this day i haven't used not even
a tiny bit of algebra on my code, especially when i'm working on something related to web development.

My point is, i know we need math to develop our abstract thinking but still, i think this subjects should be 
optional, like if you wanna specialize in something related to that, then go ahead and take probability and
calculus 100 idk. I swear the university would have less dropouts and more people inspired to follow their dreams.

At least i know i would.
