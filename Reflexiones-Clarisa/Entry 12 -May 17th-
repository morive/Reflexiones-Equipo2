Well Prof. i guess this is it. It was fun while it lasted and i really enjoyed your subject, it made me 
finally realize what i want to do with my career. I already knew that i wanted to specialize in web
development but, the whole UX/UI thing made everything more clear to me.

I just wanted to thank you for making this subject always entertaining, to always finding a way to teach us
something without making it feel hard or complex, for all the talks we had on friday's that made us think
about all the possibilities we had and that we didn't had to be stuck coding for the rest of our lifes.
I guess this isn't an actual reflection/journal idk, but i thought it was worth to say what i felt, and that
i'm actually glad that there's still teachers that enjoy what they do, because it shows. Thanks again! :)
