                                    -Testing HTG-

After making some tests of our project with the users identified, we realized that 
even though they weren't used to handling technological devices, the whole process was
really easy. With a little bit of help from our "tutorial" they were pretty much ready
to use our system, they told us that it was because everything was really easy to understand,
the letters were pretty big and you only had to "click" whatever you want.

This actually made me feel quite nice about our project, like it wasn't made just for the
assignment, it could really help people and most of all it could make a change and be more
inclusive with the one's that doesn't have the resources to get what they need.
