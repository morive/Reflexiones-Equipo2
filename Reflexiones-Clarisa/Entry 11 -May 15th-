                                  -Presential Activity-

Well i had a lot of fun thinking about this activity, 2 days prior to our presentation we spent
like 5 hours watching videos of "As seen on TV", and we came across the most unusual inventions, 
which helped us come around with some "needs" that had to be fulfilled with weird tools.

I know the teacher told us that it was difficult and we may have felt like we were ignored during 
this activity, but i still quite enjoyed the whole thing. It made me remember why the first career
i choosed was education. The fact that the classroom was laughing and enjoying everything, made me
feel like it was all worth it. I know we had some flaws but i think we still made a good job, and 
i can't wait to try it again, and surpass everyone's expectations.
