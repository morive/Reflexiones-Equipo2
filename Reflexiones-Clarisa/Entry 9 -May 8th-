There's quite a lot of new inventions regarding AI, but the problem is that not a lot of people
aren't taking full advantage of this. Whenever i think of AI, for some reason i remember those movies
where the robots take full control of the world and the humans are like the "slaves",
and even though i know its fictional, i can't shake off the gut feeling that it could happen lol.

But how long would it take us to finally reach the point where these AI could be part of our surroundings
and actually help in our everyday life? I know there's already some implementations but still, there isn't quite
enough yet. I think it would make a huge difference if we could slowly introduce it to everyone, and start to
use this technology the right way.
